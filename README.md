## üíî Why I Built This

I lost money to a phishing scam. I felt **helpless**, **frustrated**, and **angry**. That pain became my purpose.

I'm not just a developer building a hackathon project. **I'm a victim turned fighter.** I know the fear of clicking a fake link. I know the shame of falling for a scam.

**EndPhishAI exists because no one should suffer what I did.**

---

## ‚ú® What It Does

EndPhishAI detects what Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal, and URLhaus miss:

- üîó **Scan URLs** - Detect phishing links instantly
- üìß **Analyze Emails** - Check full email content for threats
- üí¨ **Check SMS** - Identify smishing attacks
- üìÑ **Scan Files** - Analyze PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, HTML

### üéØ It's Not Just Another URL Checker

Most tools only check if a URL is in a database of known threats. **That's reactive.**

**EndPhishAI is proactive.** It analyzes threats in real-time, even if they're brand new.

---

## üß† Deep Content Analysis (The Secret Sauce)

When you enable "Deep Scan", EndPhishAI actually **visits the webpage** and examines:

‚úì **HTTPS encryption status** - Is it even secure?  
‚úì **Login forms & password fields** - Are they harvesting credentials?  
‚úì **External links & redirects** - Where do buttons actually go?  
‚úì **Hidden iframes & embedded content** - Sneaky invisible threats  
‚úì **Suspicious JavaScript code** - Malicious scripts lurking in the background  
‚úì **Brand impersonation** - Is it pretending to be PayPal, your bank, M-Pesa?  
‚úì **Urgent language** - "ACT NOW OR LOSE YOUR ACCOUNT!" red flags  
‚úì **Page structure** - Does it match the real site or is it a cheap copy?

**This catches what Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal, and URLhaus miss.**

## üéÆ 4 Ways to Scan (One App, Unlimited Power)

![Detection Interface](screenshots/firstDetect.png)

**Tab 1: URL Scanner** üîó  
Paste any suspicious link. Get results in < 2 seconds. Enable "Deep Scan" for full content analysis.

**Tab 2: Email Analyzer** üìß  
Copy the ENTIRE email (sender, subject, body) and we'll analyze every part for phishing patterns.

**Tab 3: SMS Checker** üí¨  
Got a weird text? WhatsApp message? Paste it and we'll tell you if it's smishing (SMS phishing).

**Tab 4: File Scanner** üìÑ  
Upload PDF invoices, DOCX documents, HTML pages, CSV files, or TXT files. We extract text and scan for threats.

---

## üéØ Real-Time Results You Can Understand

![Phishing Detection](screenshots/test_paypal.png)

**No confusing jargon.** We explain:

- ‚úÖ **What we found** (character substitution, fake login form, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Why it's dangerous** (it's impersonating PayPal to steal passwords)
- ‚úÖ **What you should do** (DO NOT CLICK! Report it!)

**It's like having a cybersecurity expert explain things in plain English.**

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 4-Layer Protection System

![Protection Layers](screenshots/protectionLayerPaypal.png)

We don't rely on just one method. We use **four layers** working together:

```
Layer 1: Heuristic Analysis
   ‚Üì (Pattern matching, character tricks, domain analysis)
Layer 2: Machine Learning Model (99.5% accurate!)
   ‚Üì (30+ features analyzed in milliseconds)
Layer 3: Google Safe Browsing API
   ‚Üì (Check known threat databases)
Layer 4: VirusTotal + PhishTank + URLhaus
   ‚Üì (Cross-verify with multiple sources)

üö® FINAL VERDICT: Safe, Suspicious or Phishing?
```

**If even ONE layer catches something suspicious, we warn you.**

---

## üéì Learn While You Protect Yourself

![Learn Page](screenshots/LearnPage.png)

Most security tools just detect threats and stop there. **We teach you to recognize them yourself.**

**Interactive Quiz - 10 Real-World Scenarios:**

- üìß "Your bank account will be closed in 24 hours!" - Phishing or Real?
- üîó "www.paypa1.com" vs "www.paypal.com" - Can you spot the difference?
- üí¨ "You won $50,000! Click here!" - Red flag or legit?

**Streak System** üî•  
Get answers right in a row and build your streak! It's addictive (in a good way).

---

## üåç Built for Africa (Because Context Matters)

- üì≤ **M-Pesa fake verification SMS** - "Thibitisha akaunti yako haraka!"
- üè¶ **GTBank login clones** - Identical-looking fake banking pages
- üìû **MTN account suspension scams** - "Your line will be blocked!"
- üí≥ **Mobile money fraud** - Attacks targeting trust-based transactions

**5 African Languages Supported:**

- üá¨üáß English
- üá´üá∑ French
- üá∞üá™ Swahili
- üá≥üá¨ Yoruba
- üá≥üá¨ Hausa
